# CodeFormatter 

Welcome to CodeFormatter. This is my attempt at a writing a VS code extension.

I am a huge supporter of clean/well-formatted code. The goal of this project is to create a VS code extension through which a code file can be auto-formatted by the click of a button (or keyboard shortcut).

Ignore the rest of the readme, I have not set it up yet, it is just the default generated with the extension. More details and information to come.... stay tuned :)

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.




## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Following extension guidelines

Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.
